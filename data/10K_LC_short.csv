I&rsquo;m saving quite a bit myself, around $1000 monthly while still being able to pay for everything.  So if I receive the funds request I&rsquo;ll have no problem paying.  On the low side my net income is $2810, I say low because I&rsquo;ve factored in missing 2-3 days incase of emergencies and incase no overtime/bonus  is given, my company currently allows unlimited OT due to my position and the demand for it.  My current YTD average monthly income is $5992 or ($47,166.15 YTD as of 8/27/2010)   My bills include <br/><br/>$700 monthly to Jared&rsquo;s min payment is 435 (will be paid off by March) <br/>$400 car payment<br/>$200 Credit Card Payments <br/>$115 Car Insurance<br/>$60 Gas (I drive a Prius so this is generous allowance) <br/>$200 Cable/Internet/phone<br/><br/><br/><br/>My fianc&eacute;e who is in her last year of Law school (she graduates in May) will move here to Texas and that will increase our income as well.  We&rsquo;ve both committed to living with my parents (where I live currently) until we pay off the wedding.  The reason why I&rsquo;m able to bank the $1000 is because they do not charge me rent or make me pay for utilities or even food.  My cable bill is high because instead of going out all the time I spend it at home saving money.   I have over $40,000 in my retirement accounts so in a crunch I could always withdraw funds from them to pay back the loan.  I have been very responsible with my money but now need a little help to pay for the wedding.  My parents threw us an engagement party and our families gave us monetary gifts that totaled $5000 (which we still have and will pay for parts of the wedding), we&rsquo;ll receive at least the same in wedding gifts if not more. I choose the 5 year repayment to plan for the worst and should have no troubles paying this loan.  My credit history also reflects that I have an excellent payment history.    With this loan I would be able to pay for everything up front and not charge items to credit cards and even get discounts from wedding vendors if we pay cash.   I hope this explanation helps.<br/>",wedding,Wedding Funds,760xx,TX,19.94,0.0,5/1/98,0.0,,,9.0,0.0,22253,44.0,27.0,f,,1,0
